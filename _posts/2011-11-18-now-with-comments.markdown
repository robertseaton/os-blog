OS Blog now has comments, take advantage of them, just be civil. The main thing: personal attacks of any kind will not be tolerated. There are plenty of other places on the internet where you can spew hate, I don't want any of that here. 

One other thing: don't just comment to disagree or agree with something. Back it up with your reasoning, tell me a story, share some knowledge. Ask yourself: "Does this add to the discussion?" If the answer to that question is yes, post it! If not, add something: introduce yourself, tell us about what you're working on, add that crucial human element.

To kick off the discussion: what do you want to see more of on OS Blog? I'm always looking for ideas for stuff to write about.
