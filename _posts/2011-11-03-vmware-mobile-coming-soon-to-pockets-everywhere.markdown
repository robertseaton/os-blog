Earlier this week, VMWare showed off a new product: a hypervisor targeted at mobile devices. The software, backed by Verizon and Samsung, takes aim at business people around the world, allowing users to run one operating system for business and another for pleasure.

If you're anything like me, you spend a fair amount of time trying out new software, including different operating systems. Back before virtualization technology became mainstream, I had a laptop that I used solely for testing out different OSes. Some weeks, I'd wipe the machine and replace the OS 3 or 4 times. 

When it comes to our smartphones, though, most of us are far less cavalier about trying out new systems. Unless you work for Engadget, you probably only have one smartphone and you rely on it to just work. I know I've been burned in the past by installing an unstable ROM and, then, even if the install is flawless, re-downloading all your apps, typing in your wifi passphrase... what a pain!

So, it's exciting to hear that VMware is bringing virtualization to smartphones. In the demo, the virtualized phone ran two different versions of Android, 2.2 and 2.3. Currently, it seems that the software will only support switching between Android-based OSes, but it's not much of a stretch to envision a world where users can switch between Android and Windows Phone. 

Further, it's possible that virtualization will encourage more innovation among mobile operating systems. If a mobile OS is able to just target the virtualized hardware, it may be possible to run that OS on any phone that supports VMWare's technology. That would enable devs in basements everywhere to run their software on a wide variety of devices and reach a broader audience.

Plan 9 in your pocket? Maybe, just maybe.
