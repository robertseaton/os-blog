title: One Month of Plan 9
layout: post
---

There are two things bothering me.

1) I feel a little guilty that I call myself an operating systems enthusiast, but I don't use anything really out there when I want to get actual work done. I stick with Linux and OS X. 

2) I'm subscribed to the 9fans mailing list, but I'm not a Plan 9 fan. I don't actually know a whole lot about Plan 9's internals, but I'm interested in learning about them. There seem to be a lot of really smart people involved with  Plan 9 stuff. I want to be a part of that.

I'm telling you about these things because I've come up with a solution to both of these problems and it involves you. I'm going to use Plan 9 From Bell Labs to get actual work done for the next month and, each week, I'm going to tell you about my experience.

After the month is over, I'm going to repeat the whole thing, but with DragonFly BSD instead of Plan 9. Then after that month is over, I'll do it all over again, but with a different OS, and so on. 

Every Monday from now on, then, I'll be sharing my alternative operating system adventures with you. Stay tuned.
