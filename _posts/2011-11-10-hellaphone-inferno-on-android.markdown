John Floren, from Sandia National Laboratories, has announced a working port of the [Inferno operating system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_(operating_system)) to the Android kernel, dubbed [Hellaphone](https://bitbucket.org/floren/inferno/wiki/Home). Two summer interns, Joel Armstrong and Joshua Landgraf, are credited as having done the lion's share of the work. 

Hellaphone currently runs on two devices, the Nexus S and Nook Color, but it shouldn't prove too difficult to add support for other Android devices, provided that they are capable of running CynanogenMod, as there are only about 100 lines of device specific code. I'm looking into getting Hellaphone running on the Atrix.

The project offers a sort of bizarre look at what could have been, since the Inferno design committee came to many of the sames conclusions as the Oak project, which later became Java. It makes you wonder: if Bell Labs had launched an agressive marketing campaign promoting [Limbo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limbo_(programming_language)) (their Java-like language) like Sun Microsystems did with Java, is it possible that all Android phones would be powered by technology derived from Inferno rather than their current Java-derived offering?
