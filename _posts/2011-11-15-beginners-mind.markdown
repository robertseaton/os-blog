title: Beginner's Mind

There are about 100 skills that I'd like to master, but I hate being a beginner. I'm trying to get networking functioning on my Plan 9 install and I'm acutely aware of the limitations of my knowledge. 

The Japanese have a word for the beginner's mind, shoshin (初心). Zen Buddhism teaches that you should cherish shoshin, even preserve, cultivate it, as the beginner's mind is a mind that has no preconceptions or judgements.  Without beginner's mind, you can get so caught up in what you think you know that it can be hard to see what is right in front of you.

In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, in the expert's there are few.
