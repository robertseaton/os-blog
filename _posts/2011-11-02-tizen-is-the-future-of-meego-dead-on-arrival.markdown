In September, Intel and Samsung announced a joint effort to build an operating system targeted at primarily mobile devices: smartphones, tablets, netbooks, in-vehicle infotainment, and smart TVs. The operating system was dubbed Tizen and intended to replace MeeGo at some point in the future.

It's readily apparent why Intel is willing to invest in the future of mobile operating systems: if Intel doesn't manage to mount a serious mobile campaign in the short to mid-term, this author envisions a future where most of the value of an Intel processor is realized by a small section of the market that requires compatibility with legacy applications.

However, more than a month has passed since the initial Tizen announcement and we haven't heard a peep out of the project, despite promises that they would "post additional details about this project in the coming weeks, including the code, developer documentation, and more." For a project that claims "development 
will be completely open," there's no evidence that any development is actually happening!

There's certainly no development taking place on [the official mailing list](https://lists.tizen.org/pipermail/general/2011-October/date.html#130) and, more surprising, there doesn't seem to be anyone representing the Tizen project interacting with the community. There are posts expressing interest in contributing to Tizen that are nearly a month old and still have yet to receive any response.

I can't help but wonder: is Tizen dead-on-arrival? Why isn't Intel taking mobile seriously?
